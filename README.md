# Scalable ECS Architecture with Gatus

Gatus is a health dashboard that monitors services over HTTP, ICMP, TCP and DNS queries, and evaluates the results based on collected metrics.

This repo contains Terraform code to deploy a scalable, highly available architecture on AWS ECS (EC2 launch type). The setup includes:

- Dockerised Gatus app
- CI/CD pipeline – GitHub Actions workflow to build, test, and push the Docker image to Amazon ECR  
- Infrastructure – managed by Terraform, provisioning ECS clusters, EC2 instances, security groups, and an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Security – SSL certificates, automatic HTTP → HTTPS redirects, security groups and least-privilege configurations for usability without compromising security
- DNS – Route53 A record mapping the domain to the ALB DNS name.

## VPC 

**Networking**
- region: `eu-west-2`
- 3 Public subnets, one in each Availability Zone (AZ).
- 3 Private subnets, one in each AZ.
- 1 Internet Gateway (IGW) providing internet access for resources in a public subnet
- 3 NAT Gateways (one per AZ) providing outbound internet access for private subnets.
- 1 Public route → IGW
- 3 Private routes → 3 NAT Gateway in the corresponding AZ for high availability.

**Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
- deployed across all 3 public subnets.
- distributes traffic to containers registered in a Target Group.
- HTTPS (port 443) listener with SSL certificate.
- HTTP listener → HTTPS redirection for encryption.

**ECS Service**
- registers tasks' IP addresses with the ALB Target Group
- uses AWS VPC networking mode, creating an ENI for each container.

**Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**
- scales EC2 instances in or out based on demand

**Capacity Provider**
- abstracts underlying EC2 resources for ECS services
- works with ASG

**Security Groups**
- allow inbound HTTPS (`443`) from `0.0.0.0/0` to the ALB
- allow traffic from ALB to ECS tasks only

**Route53:**
- a record (alias) pointing to the ALB DNS name

**IAM**
- Task Role provides permissions required by ECS tasks
- EC2 Role allows ECS instances to join the ECS cluster and pull images from Amazon ECR

**CloudWatch**
- collects logs from the ECS cluster for observability and debugging.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo  
2. Configure AWS credentials  
3. Run `terraform init && terraform apply`  
4. Deploy the application via GitHub Actions  


## Further Improvements

 - [X] state versioning
- [ ] add github OIDC provider to my bootstrap 
- [ ] integrate "curl https://tm.<your-domain>/health" health check into my pipeline
- [ ] store config.yaml in S3 bucket and pass it to the tasks at runtime rather than in the container image to prevent rebuilding and in my case recompressing the image which can make builds longer
- [ ] create scripts to perform checks for ECS and other resources
- [ ] create own provider and module to work with GoDaddy
- [ ] create action to list all resources currently in use on AWS
- [ ] create script to watch ECS service live as tasks are being created and when being destroyed, it would be useful for troubleshooting.
- [ ] create VPC endpoints to lower the costs of NAT gateways
- [ ] enable tagging of resources
- [ ] move all the terraform folder in folder terraform/modules and move bootstrap into terraform/bootstrap
- [ ] experiment with FinOps. See what other decisions I can make to cut costs
